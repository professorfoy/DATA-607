The information learned can also be applied to recommending the optimal plan for larger companies. Students also learn how to design a plan to meet the needs of the business. An adoption agreement case study exercise illustrates how the ERISA rules translate into creating an effective plan design that meets the business’s needs. Students will also be able to help clients navigate through the maze of plan administration issues. Part of the course focuses on individual retirement planning. This part of the course enables students to identify the steps in the retirement planning process, calculate the savings the client will need for retirement, advise a client as to how to avoid the 72(t) penalty, recommend strategies for complying with required minimum distribution rules, advise clients about qualified plan distribution options, and advise clients as to when rollovers are desirable. This is a required class for MSTFP students.

Students learn how to design the optimal long-term care insurance contract and choose the best Medigap policy for their clients. One focus of the class is on the various annuity products and how they can be used to meet the financial and retirement planning needs of a client. The course also reviews business, disability, and property casualty insurance products and strategies. A final focus of this class is to help students develop their research and professional speaking skills. To this end, an oral presentation is required based on a topic the student researches.

Roll play throughout the course puts students in the role of financial planner to experience each step of the financial planning process, culminating with written and oral presentations. Students interview the client and perform fact finding to gather data necessary to develop the plan. They apply critical thinking to their analysis, integrating skills learned in topic specific courses, including investments,  taxation, retirement planning, insurance, and estate planning to generate and implement creative solutions through a holistic solution for the client. To provide an experience that simulates an actual client/advisor relationship, the instructor role plays the  client while working with the class to develop a common draft plan before each student implements his/her individual solution. The course culminates with a day of oral presentations, assessed by an independent CFP® practitioner, during which each student experiences alternative approaches presented by his/her peers. Please note: the financial plans are a valuable addition to student’s portfolio of graduate work that can be used to submit to prospective employers during the job application process.
