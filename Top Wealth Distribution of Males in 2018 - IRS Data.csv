"[1] Total assets is the sum of all assets owned by the individual before subtracting debts, mortgages, and liens owed to others.  It differs from gross assets, which is a Federal estate tax concept of wealth, in that it includes the cash value of life insurance instead of the full face value of life insurance minus indebtedness.  Estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5.45 million are required to file in 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
